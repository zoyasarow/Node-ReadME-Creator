# Project Pride Month

## Description 
This application allows for dynamic scheduling of events, meetings and other occasions through a scheduling system that allows for folks working in LGBTQIA2+ & Queer Advocacy during the month of Pride (June) or any busy work time periods. The motivation for this project was to help scheduling become easier by having one application for most scheduling needs versus multiple applications. The challenge that this application works to alleviate is that of multiple time management applications. Through developing this application, the developers learned how to use npm functionality and generateMarkdowns
